        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            It's not often your taste buds crave the creamy texture of creamed organ soup, and
            even if they don't, this recipe is still a must for any culinarian to learn. It is
            a higly valued dinner for those few who enjoy it (mostly Vy'keen gluttons), so there are tonnes of units
            to be earned if you are not put off by intestines and the likes. The recipie is
            quite simple, so long as you have all the required ingredients.
