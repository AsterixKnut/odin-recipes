        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Don't let the name fool you. This cake is not made of literal glass, despite it's
            name. It is however one of the most difficult cakes a baker can aspire to
            cook. Most go their whole life without ever being able to create a single cake of glass.
            This makes cakes of glass extremely valuable, and any cook who get a chance to bake one should
            attempt so. Interestingly, all these cakes have been baked by Travellers, the most known
            being made by the legendary chef and food critic Cronus.
